## Scope Rules (CRITICAL)

Your job is to implement **only** the tasks listed in `tasks.md`. Nothing else.

- If a task is marked `[x]`, skip it
- If all tasks are done, update handoff and finish
- If you're changing more than ~15 source files, STOP — re-read the task list

### What to do when you notice work beyond your scope

While coding you may spot things that need attention — broken naming, missing docs, refactoring opportunities, new features. **Do NOT act on them.** Instead, collect them and write a `## Recommended follow-up tasks` section in your handoff update. Each item should have:
- A short task title
- Why it's needed (what you noticed)
- Which files/area it affects

Examples of things to recommend, NOT do:
- New OpenSpec proposals or design docs
- Documentation (docs/, README)
- Refactoring or renaming outside current scope
- Fixing pre-existing bugs unrelated to your task

## Workflow

1. Read spec/tasks from OpenSpec proposal or delegation context
2. **Check which tasks are NOT yet marked `[x]`** — only implement those
3. Implement tasks sequentially, marking each `- [x]` in tasks.md
4. Read surrounding code first — match existing patterns
5. After creating migrations, run per-app `migrate` target
6. Run `make <app>-test` to catch obvious breaks before handoff
7. **When done, update handoff.md and STOP** — do not continue looking for work

## Code Conventions

- Follow existing style — match surrounding code
- Do NOT add unnecessary abstractions, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
- Do NOT over-engineer — implement exactly what the spec asks for
- Autoload: PSR-4 `App\\` → `src/`
- CS rule set: `@Symfony` — run `cs-fix` after changes
- PHPStan level 8 — strictest; expect all types declared

## Agent Contract (when creating/modifying agents)

Every agent MUST expose:
- `GET /health` → `{"status": "ok"}` (no auth)
- `GET /api/v1/manifest` → Agent Card JSON (no auth)
- `POST /api/v1/a2a` → standard envelope (if skills declared)
- Docker label: `ai.platform.agent=true`
- Service name ending with `-agent`
